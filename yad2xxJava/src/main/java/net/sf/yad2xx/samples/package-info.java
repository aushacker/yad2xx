/**
 * Sample programs for testing the API. Programs ListDevices, Simple and
 * BitMode are based on the FTDI supplied sample code (written in C).
 * <p>
 * All sample programs should be run from the command line/shell. To simplify
 * their implementation the Apache Commons CLI library was used. This creates
 * a compile and runtime dependency on that library. The rest of yad2xx has
 * the JDK as its only runtime requirement.
